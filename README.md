Welcome to the TalkieWalkie monorepo: code for server, webapp, iOS app &amp; their deployment files. 
The TW project has ended and there won't be any activity here. 
I've scanned the repo with [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) before releasing the repo - and nothing of note is there - all accounts have been closed.
